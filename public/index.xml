      <description>This sample post is mainly for blogdown users. If you do not use blogdown, you can skip the first section.&#xA;1. Markdown or R Markdown This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:&#xA;You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Goldmark by default, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.</description>

      <title>About Hugo XMin</title>
      <link>https://example.org/about/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://example.org/about/</guid>
      <description>XMin is the first Hugo theme I have designed. The original reason that I wrote it was I needed a minimal example of Hugo themes when I was writing the blogdown book. Basically I wanted a simple theme that supports a navigation menu, a home page, other single pages, lists of pages, blog posts, categories, tags, and RSS. That is all. Nothing fancy. In terms of CSS and JavaScript, I really want to keep them minimal.</description>
