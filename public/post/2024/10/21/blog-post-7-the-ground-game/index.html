<p><em>This blog is an ongoing assignment for Gov 1347: Election Analytics, a course at Harvard College taught by Professor <a href="https://www.ryandenos.com/">Ryan Enos</a>. It will be updated weekly and culminate in a predictive model of the 2024 presidential election.</em></p>

How effective is the <em>ground game</em> at swinging election outcomes? Ultimately, can <em>campaign events</em> help predict these results?</h2>
<p><em>Knock knock.</em> You open your front door to find a <strong>campaign volunteer</strong>, clipboard in hand, eager to talk to you about the upcoming election. We&rsquo;ve all seen these people randomly roaming our neighborhoods. In reality, this is <strong>just one piece of the larger ground game strategy,</strong> where candidates and their teams hit the pavement, host rallies, and knock on doors to <strong>sway voters face-to-face.</strong> But with digital ads and viral tweets dominating the outreach scene, <strong>how effective is this old-school approach?</strong></p>
<p>Some argue that this holds the secret to electoral success, while others say that rallies and door-knocking are <strong>more symbolic than substantial.</strong> So, can these campaign events and personal interactions <strong>really move the needle</strong> and predict state-level results? Or, is this all <strong>just political theater?</strong></p>
<p>As always, let&rsquo;s start with the data!</p>
<h2 id="back-to-polls">Back To Polls?</h2>
<p>To begin our analysis, let&rsquo;s take a step back and first examine <strong>state-specific forecasts for Democratic and Republican vote shares</strong> based on polling data:</p>
<img src="https://example.org/post/2024/10/21/blog-post-7-the-ground-game/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png" width="672" />
<p>Here, we can see that for each state, <strong>the blue line represents the Democratic vote share prediction</strong>, while the <strong>red line</strong> represents the <strong>Republican vote share.</strong> Immediately, we notice that for most states, <strong>as poll support increases,</strong> the predicted vote share for <strong>both parties also increases.</strong> This makes sense.</p>
<p>However, there are also some issues with the plot. For example, some states have odd patterns, <strong>such as negative slopes or very high variance,</strong> suggesting that the linear models <strong>may not fit well</strong> in certain states. For example, in <strong>Nevada (NV), we see high variance in predictions, while in Mississippi (MS),</strong> there might be a negative slope, which is <strong>unrealistic</strong> for real-world elections. Historically, polling errors are more pronounced in states with <strong>smaller or harder-to-reach populations,</strong> such as Nevada. Other accuracy concerns include factors like <strong>partisan lean and polling methodology.</strong></p>
<p>Thus, we&rsquo;re seeing instances when polling data might be <strong>unreliable</strong> or where the relationship between polling support and actual vote share is <strong>rather weak.</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a closer look at two key states:</p>
<img src="https://example.org/post/2024/10/21/blog-post-7-the-ground-game/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="672" />
<p>For California, we can see that the <strong>Democrats have a higher predicted vote share across almost all polling support levels</strong> compared to Republicans. Historically democratic years like <strong>2020, 2016, and 2008 align closely</strong> with the predicted vote share for Democrats at mid-to-high polling support. On the other hand, years like 1980 and 1984 show Republicans doing better, but this <strong>makes sense as California was less reliably blue at the time.</strong></p>
<p>In contrast, Florida reveals how the lines are closer together, indicating a <strong>more competitive electoral environment</strong> between the two parties. At the same time, the confidence intervals in Florida are wider, reflecting <strong>more uncertainty</strong> in the model&rsquo;s predictions. This is likely due to Florida’s <strong>more volatile voting patterns</strong> and demographic shifts, making it harder to predict election outcomes based solely on polling.</p>
<h2 id="voting-eligible-population----pennsylvania">Voting Eligible Population &ndash; Pennsylvania</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a deeper dive into the <strong>voting-eligible population (VEP).</strong> These people represent the portion of the population that is <strong>legally eligible to vote.</strong> Knowing the VEP helps in predicting election outcomes, <strong>especially in close races.</strong> A growing or shrinking VEP can significantly <strong>alter electoral dynamics, especially in battleground states.</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s examine a specific battleground case study:</p>
<img src="https://example.org/post/2024/10/21/blog-post-7-the-ground-game/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png" width="672" />
<p>Here, we see that Pennsylvania has shown a <strong>steady, nearly linear increase in the VEP</strong> over the last few decades, reflecting population growth and demographic shifts. The red regression line hugs the points closely, <strong>predicting future VEP based on historical trends.</strong> Thus, we can ultimately assess how much influence a growing population could have on <strong>turnout rates and on election results.</strong></p>
<p>Now, let&rsquo;s expand the OLS model to include <strong>generalized additive modeling (GAM)</strong> and use a weighted average to create a final prediction:</p>
<img src="https://example.org/post/2024/10/21/blog-post-7-the-ground-game/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png" width="672" />
<pre><code>## [1] 10044706
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we&rsquo;re adding a <strong>75% weight to the GAM prediction, and a 25% weight to the OLS prediction.</strong> We can immediately see how GAM provides much <strong>more flexibility</strong> by allowing the model to fit a <strong>curved relationship between VEP and time,</strong> capturing complex demographic changes that might influence VEP growth in the future. As a result, <strong>our final VEP prediction for 2024 is approximately, 10,044,706.</strong></p>
<p>Crossing 10 million eligible voters by the next election has <strong>significant implications</strong> for Pennsylvania&rsquo;s electoral dynamics, as a larger electorate could <strong>change the composition of young voters,</strong> influencing overall turnout and election outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="field-offices-and-the-ground-game">Field Offices and The Ground Game</h2>
<p>Field offices play a crucial role in elections in terms of <strong>voter outreach and mobilization.</strong> These offices act as hubs for campaigns to <strong>connect directly with voters, organize events, and more.</strong> This allows for more specialized campaign strategies with tailored messaging and <strong>more rapid response to local issues.</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s trace the data across 2012 and 2016:</p>

<p>Here, we can see how the Obama campaign <strong>deployed a widespread and dense network of field offices,</strong> with a heavy concentration in battleground states like <strong>Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania.</strong> Clinton followed a similar strategy, with a focus on the <strong>Midwest battleground states</strong>. However, a lagging voter turnout in crucial areas especially among <strong>working-class voters in the Rust Belt</strong> was one of the reasons for her defeat.</p>
<p>The Republicans showed a <strong>significant shift from 2012 to 2016.</strong> We can see how Trump&rsquo;s campaign had a more focused field office strategy, <strong>targeting specific battlegrounds like Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Michigan.</strong> However, his campaign relied heavily on <strong>digital outreach and rallies</strong> rather than a traditional field game. This unconventional method allowed him to increase his presence and reach, <strong>generating a high turnout, particularly in rural and exurban areas.</strong></p>
<h2 id="the-democratic-ground-game">The Democratic Ground Game</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s dive deeper into Democratic field office work in battleground states by comparing some more historical trends:</p>

<p>Here we can see how in most battleground states, <strong>Clinton had fewer field offices in 2016 than Obama did in 2008,</strong> indicated by the substantial negative values. This was detrimental when considering crucial states like Ohio, Florida, and Pennsylvania —- all critical swing states that contributed to Trump&rsquo;s victory.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we see that the graph shows how <strong>Clinton&rsquo;s campaign may have underinvested in field offices</strong> compared to Obama’s 2008 campaign, particularly in key Rust Belt states. These offices play a <strong>crucial role in get-out-the-vote (GOTV) efforts,</strong> volunteer mobilization, and localized campaign activities. This made it <strong>more challenging to mobilize Democratic voters,</strong> particularly in areas where <strong>voter enthusiasm may have been lower</strong> than in 2008.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s continue our analysis by looking at 2012 and 2016:</p>

<p>Once again, we see how Obama had a <strong>dense network of field offices spread across Wisconsin,</strong> particularly concentrated in urban and suburban areas, including the Milwaukee and Madison regions. His aggressive ground game aimed at <strong>reaching a wide range of voters through traditional canvassing and mobilization efforts.</strong> Comparatively, we can see Clinton&rsquo;s <strong>fewer offices,</strong> especially in rural areas and northern parts of the state.</p>
<img src="https://example.org/post/2024/10/21/blog-post-7-the-ground-game/index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png" width="672" />
<p>As expected, Obama <strong>won many counties by comfortable margins,</strong> particularly in urban areas like Milwaukee, Madison, and along the state&rsquo;s southern border. His distribution across both urban and rural areas helped <strong>increase turnout in a wide range of regions.</strong></p>
<p>Comparatively for Clinton, many of the counties turned red, highlighting how <strong>Trump outperformed Clinton in large parts of Wisconsin,</strong> especially in rural areas. Her concentrated efforts in urban areas came at <strong>the cost of losing support from rural and working-class voters.</strong></p>

<p>As predicted, <strong>both parties are concentrating their campaign events in battleground states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Arizona.</strong> These are crucial Rust Belt states that helped decide the 2020 election results. They also have a significant presence in Georgia and Arizona, <strong>two historically Republican states that flipped to the Democrats in 2020,</strong> suggesting that Democrats are working to consolidate their gains in these areas.</p>
<p>The Republicans are also concentrating in battleground states, but are also <strong>hosting events in Ohio, Florida, and North Carolina, which have been traditionally red</strong> but occasionally competitive. Doing so will help <strong>secure support in historical strongholds</strong> while trying to gain a <strong>competitive edge in the swing states.</strong></p>
<p>Overall, we can see how both parties are hosting fewer campaign events in traditionally solid states, <strong>allocating more of their resources to swing states where the outcomes are more unpredictable.</strong></p>
<h2 id="campaign-events-and-predicting-vote-share">Campaign Events and Predicting Vote Share?</h2>
<p>We can clearly see trends in campaign events, presence in battleground states, and historical results. <strong>Thus, can we use this information to improve our model and predict vote share?</strong></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s find out:</p>

<p>Here, we can see that for each additional Democratic event in a state, <strong>the Democratic vote share is expected to increase by roughly 0.126 percentage points,</strong> with a statistically significant p-value. However, the <strong>R-squared value is very low,</strong> suggesting that it only captures roughly 1.87% of the variance in state-level vote share based on the number of campaign events and the event difference.</p>
<p>Is this consistent with the Republican model?</p>

<p>Interestingly, the model predicts that for each additional Republican event, <strong>the Republican vote share decreases by roughly 0.126 percentage points</strong>, with a statistically significant p-value. This could mean that Republicans tend to hold events in more competitive or difficult states, <strong>where their baseline support is lower.</strong></p>
<p>However, the positive association in <strong>ev_diff_R_D</strong> suggests that Republicans <strong>benefit more</strong> then they hold more events than Democrats, showing how the ground game is <strong>particularly effective when they out-campaign Democrats in terms of event presence.</strong></p>
<p>Still, the very low R-squared value suggests that while campaign events can influence voter engagement and media coverage, <strong>they cannot account for most of the variance in state-level vote shares.</strong> Statistically, the high residual standard error compared to the effect sizes indicates that there is <strong>a lot of unexplained noise in the relationship between the predictors.</strong> While the coefficients are statistically significant, meaning there is some measurable impact on vote share, <strong>it is relatively small in the broader context of all factors</strong> that determine election outcomes that we&rsquo;ve seen in previous blogs.</p>
<p>Thus, I predict that its addition to our model will likely produce negligible impact&hellip;<strong>especially when election day is only 14 days away!</strong></p>
<p>Stay tuned!</p>
